# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A model is proposed using Supervised Learning Algorithm which will predict whether a patient is suffering from heart disease or not.
Here I have used algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision tress which yeild an accuracy of 81.10%, 81.48 % and 78.36 % respectively.
The dataset was given by Drivendata.org which consists of 13 features with 70,000 rows.
Another file(disease prediction.py) consists of code where I have implemented CNN model for the classifcation of images.
